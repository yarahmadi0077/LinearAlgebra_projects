    "Input-output analysis is a form of macroeconomic analysis based on the interdependencies between different economic sectors or industries.\n",
    "As you know the ecconomy divides into sectors where each sector produces goods and services not only for itself but also for other sectors so each sector has an effect on others.\n",
    "This model helps us to find out how much goods do we need to produce in order to meet the outside and intermidiate demands.\n",
    "The leontief model is branched into two submodels : closed and open.\n",

    "- closed model : all production is consumed by industries.\n",

    "the equation for the open model is x = Cx + d, where d represents he demand matrix. In a closed economy, the equation is x = Cx, which means the total input equals the total output."
